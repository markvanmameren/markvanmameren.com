The UWV always had separate websites where users could, for example, sick reports can be submitted or benefits can be applied for. In the past it used to be a major investment to maintain all these packages, but with this new system these sites can be realtime generated with a simple JSON file. My job description is mainly building new components, unit testing and add NgRX functionality. In addition, Iâ€™m building a website builder that business analists can use to create or edit websites using a drag & drop system, which can export the necessary JSON file.',
